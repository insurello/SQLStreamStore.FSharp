# SqlStreamStore.FSharp

A thin F# wrapper around [SQLStreamStore](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SqlStreamStore), and [SqlStreamStore.Postgres](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SqlStreamStore.Postgres).

This library isn't intended to be an implementation of an event store on top of SqlStreamStore. It only wraps some simple functions in SqlStreamStore in F#, mostly to turn `Tasks` to `Asyncs` and offers some nice-to-haves eg. a Postgres config record type instead of a string.

Wrapping only the basic functionality, and sticking to the naming conventions in the original library gives the flexibility to model events, aggregates, error types, etc.. however the user sees fit.


## Supported functionality
- Connecting to Postgres
- Reading a `StreamMessage`
- Appending a `StreamMessage`

## Not Supported functionality
- Subscriptions aren't going to be supported. Wrapping them is more awkward than using C# in F#.

## TODO

- ~~Postgres connector~~
- ~~Read a stream message~~
- ~~Write a stream message~~
- ~~Subscribe to a stream~~
- ~~Work on Read, and Append modules that wrap read and appends in AsyncResult type for error handeling~~
- Add additional tests when Append and Read fail, and throw exceptions.
- Add functionality to Read to be able to get messages directly.
